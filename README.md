# NoMoreTricksterDupe

## What's this?
This repository is for blocking exchange cheats. If you are an end user, just download the ``GameServerRelease.exe`` file located in ./binary/. This is compatible with public s2 server release.

And if you can code, you can also find out the detailed reason in ``Discovery.md``.

## I wanna manual patch!
Modify the offset ``0xFF70D`` from ``5F 39``, to ``8F 3A``. However, it is only compatible with the public trickster S2 server release.
